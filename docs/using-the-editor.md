# Using the Editor

The editor consists of several components:
- The topbar, which has formatting (e.g **bold**, *italic*, <u>underline</u>, etc)
- The sidebar, which has note sharing, download and settings
- The bottom bar, which has AI tools, like summarizing, paragraph generation, or flashcards (note, flashcards are only available on certain accounts)

On mobile devices, the bottom and sidebar are combined.
